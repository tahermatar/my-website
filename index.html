            <p><strong id="aboutMe">About me</strong><br>
                My full name is <span>Taher Youssef Matar</span>,
                 my date of birth is 23/6/2000, I live in the city of Rafah,
                  since my childhood and I love engineering, programming and the computer world
                  . This is what prompted me to enroll in the Faculty of Engineering and Information
                   Technology at Al-Azhar University. Currently, I am in the fourth level, the first semester,
                    which is about to end, as I am supposed to be in the fourth level, the second semester, 
                    but I was late for a semester because of the difficult financial situation that made me I am postponing
                     a semester and don't know if the financial circumstances will allow me to register next year or not,During 
                     these school years, I have a good programming background
                      I also mentioned that I love programming and always strive to develop myself in this field and learn as much as possible
                       to reach the stage that I have sufficient knowledge. There is no doubt that this work is developing and this is the reason
                        why I love The field and I want to increase my knowledge and abilities myself, but when self-learning sometimes I do not
                         continue and interrupt, and this is one of the reasons that prompted me to register in this academy.<br><br>
                     <strong>Why do I want to enroll in this program</strong><br>
                     I would like to join this program because, as I mentioned,
                      I am a software engineering major and I want to learn more to become a professional in my field,
                       This program allows me to learn and follow along with you. Because I also want to complete my studies, that is, if I am accepted in this program, I will be able to enter the labor market, which will make me save my tuition fees and I also have a goal that I want to see the labor market and learn from it
                         As much as possible and understand how local and international companies operate to gain experience that will
                          Let me in the future build my own team or company and this experience doesn't even come
                          After the practice and for it to work, I must have sufficient knowledge that qualifies me and
                           It opens the way for all of these goals, and I see this program providing me with that knowledge. <br><br>
